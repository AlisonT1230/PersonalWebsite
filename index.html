        <p>
            My name is Alison and I'm a computer science specialist student at U of T.  
            I found my love for computer science when I was in high school, taking my first course on the subject where 
            I greatly enjoyed developing the final project with a team of friends.  
            I've always loved learning how things work and using that knowledge in my own applications.

        <p class="bordered">What I Do</p>
        <p>
            In my time outside of academics, I like to work on personal projects to expand my skillset outside of 
            what the university offers.  This includes creating games, experimenting with new tools, photography and 
            graphic design.  Additionally, I am part of the Dana Project developer team and I hold a position of 
            Ads and Publicity Director at Innis Residence.

        <p>
            Some of my programming-related personal projects can be found on my GitHub.
            Outside of computer science, I've also learned the basics of video production, photography and 
            vector design.

            <p class="bordered">What I Want To Do</p>
            <p>
                I would like to learn about and work with a wide variety of computer science topics, including web 
                development, mobile development and game design.  That being said, I am always excited to take on 
                new challenges in other areas of computer science.
